                                            welcome change and gearshift in customers who will eat a rib eye or tomahawk steak and come in the next day and have a vegan pizza. It’s just been highlighted with the [increasing number of] restaurants we’ve
                                            got because it’s something that’s on the rise. It’s something that needs to be highly considered and something that needs to be seriously adaptable on a daily basis. So you move with it – or it moves you. And
                                            I’m moving with it. I remember Alain Passard in Paris when he won his third Michelin star; a year later he turned his restaurant vegetarian and still had three stars. How cool is that? A great testament to the
                                            chef.</p>

                                    The level of exposure with these awards is important, and it’s a really nice confirmation to how good you are. So what would I do if there was no Michelin Guide? There would be the Good Food Guide, the AA Guide, there’s
                                    always a guide somewhere. They are taken seriously but it’s not what we cook for.</p>
